Okay, I will break down the task into smaller, manageable steps.

**Overall Strategy:**

1.  **Data Acquisition:** Scrape the relevant data from the provided Wikipedia URL using a library like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` in Python.
2.  **Data Processing and Cleaning:**
    *   Parse the HTML content to extract the table containing film information.
    *   Clean the extracted data:
        *   Convert gross earnings to numeric values (removing '$' and commas).
        *   Convert the release years to integers.
        *   Handle any missing data appropriately (e.g., remove rows with missing values or impute).
3.  **Question Answering:** Implement logic to answer each of the provided questions using the processed data.
4.  **Visualization (Question 4):** Generate a scatter plot with a regression line using `matplotlib` and encode the image to base64.
5.  **Output:** Return the answers as a JSON array of strings.

**Detailed Steps:**

1.  **Data Acquisition and Initial Parsing:**

    *   **Action:** Use `requests` to fetch the HTML content from "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films".
    *   **Action:** Use `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML content. Target the table containing the film information. Inspect the HTML structure to identify the correct `<table>` tag.
    *   **Action:** Extract the table rows (`<tr>`) and cells (`<td>`) to get the data.
    *   **Action:** Store the scraped data into a suitable data structure (e.g., a list of dictionaries or a pandas DataFrame). Each dictionary/row should represent a film and contain keys like "Rank", "Title", "Worldwide gross", "Year", and "Peak".

2.  **Data Cleaning and Conversion:**

    *   **Action:** Clean the "Worldwide gross" column: Remove the '$' symbol and the commas from the gross earnings string. Convert the cleaned strings into float values.
    *   **Action:** Convert the "Year" column to integer values.
    *   **Action:** Clean the "Peak" column to make it numeric by: Remove '$' sign and any commas, convert the string to float or integer.
    *   **Action:** Handle potential errors during the cleaning process (e.g., missing data, invalid number formats). Consider removing the invalid rows or imputing missing values.

3.  **Question Answering Implementation:**

    *   **Question 1: How many $2 bn movies were released before 2020?**
        *   **Action:** Filter the data to include only films with "Worldwide gross" >= 2000000000.0 (2 billion).
        *   **Action:** Further filter the filtered data to include only films with "Year" < 2020.
        *   **Action:** Count the number of films remaining after these two filters.
        *   **Action:** Convert the count to a string.
    *   **Question 2: Which is the earliest film that grossed over $1.5 bn?**
        *   **Action:** Filter the data to include only films with "Worldwide gross" > 1500000000.0.
        *   **Action:** Find the minimum "Year" from the filtered dataset.
        *   **Action:** Find the "Title" corresponding to that minimum "Year".
        *   **Action:** Convert the film title to a string.
    *   **Question 3: What's the correlation between the Rank and Peak?**
        *   **Action:** Extract the "Rank" and "Peak" columns as numerical lists.
        *   **Action:** Use a library like `numpy` or `pandas` to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the two lists.
        *   **Action:** Convert the correlation coefficient to a string.

4.  **Visualization (Question 4):**

    *   **Action:** Extract "Rank" and "Peak" from your cleaned data.
    *   **Action:** Use `matplotlib` to create a scatter plot:
        *   `plt.scatter(Rank, Peak)`
    *   **Action:** Calculate the linear regression line using `numpy.polyfit`.
    *   **Action:** Plot the regression line on the same scatter plot using `plt.plot`.  Make the line dotted and red (e.g., `plt.plot(x, y_regression, linestyle='dotted', color='red')`).
    *   **Action:** Save the plot to a temporary in-memory file using `io.BytesIO`.
    *   **Action:** Encode the image in base64. `base64.b64encode(img.getvalue()).decode('utf-8')`
    *   **Action:** Create the final data URI string `"data:image/png;base64,..."`.
    *   **Action:** Ensure the image is under 100,000 bytes by adjusting the plot resolution if needed.

5.  **Output Generation:**

    *   **Action:** Combine all the answers into a JSON array of strings.

**Libraries to Use:**

*   `requests`: For fetching the HTML content.
*   `BeautifulSoup4`: For parsing the HTML.
*   `pandas` (optional but highly recommended): For data manipulation and cleaning. Can simplify the extraction, cleaning, and correlation calculation.
*   `numpy`: For numerical calculations (correlation and regression).
*   `matplotlib`: For creating the scatter plot and regression line.
*   `io`:  For handling the in-memory image data.
*   `base64`: For encoding the image to base64.
*   `json`: For creating JSON output.

By following these steps, you should be able to automate the process of scraping, analyzing, and visualizing the Wikipedia data and generate the final JSON output. Remember to handle errors and consider edge cases throughout the process for robust results.
